# Abacus-Teaching-Program
It lets someone see how an abacus does math. Learning abacus math isn't necessarily hard, its just different due to the way the bead movements work. This app plans on making that difference easier to overcome through example. This program implements interactive abacus with which a person (or a child) can see how to preform arithmatic. This app is primary for students trying to learn abacus but can be useful to anyone who wonders how they work or just wants to see beads move up and down.
